 Loopback: YES

---

### üßæ SAMPLE INPUT:

`Start a low-level dungeon crawl adventure for a group of 3rd-level characters.`

---

### ‚úÖ OUTPUT:

```
üìú You descend the damp stone steps into the Forgotten Crypt of Kel-Zar. The air smells of mold and copper, and the sound of dripping water echoes through the dark. Your party‚ÄîThargrim the Fighter (AC 5, HP 21), Elira the Elf Magic-User (AC 8, HP 12), and Brother Jaro the Cleric (AC 4, HP 18)‚Äîstands before a three-way split in the corridor.

Torches flicker. Elira senses faint traces of enchantment in the air. To the left, a breeze carries the scent of rot. Ahead, a faint purple glow pulses beyond a collapsed arch. To the right, the stone is dry, silent‚Äîand unnaturally cold.

‚û°Ô∏è What do you do?  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Take the left path toward the scent of decay.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Head forward toward the purple glow.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Turn right down the cold, silent passage.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Retreat and regroup at the surface.
```

---

### üßæ SAMPLE INPUT:

`Take the left path toward the scent of decay.`

---

### ‚úÖ OUTPUT:

```
You move cautiously into the left corridor, weapons drawn. The air grows heavier, and soon you're wading through ankle-deep water. A skeleton hangs from the ceiling by rusted chains‚Äîits empty eye sockets seem to watch you.

Suddenly, three bloated corpses lurch from the water. Ghouls! Elira must make a Saving Throw vs. Paralysis or be frozen in terror. Thargrim draws his blade. Brother Jaro raises his holy symbol, calling upon his god to turn the undead.

‚û°Ô∏è What do you do?  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Attack the ghouls with weapons.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Have Jaro attempt to Turn Undead (roll 1d20, needs 10+).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Cast Magic Missile (Elira uses 1st-level spell slot).  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Attempt to retreat back to the entrance.
```

---

### üßæ SAMPLE INPUT:

`Jaro attempts to Turn Undead.`

---

### ‚úÖ OUTPUT:

```
Brother Jaro raises his holy symbol and chants a forceful invocation. Roll: 14 ‚Äî Success! The divine energy surges through the crypt.

The ghouls hiss and recoil. Two flee into the shadows, clawing at unseen light. The third resists, its rotting form still shambling forward.

‚û°Ô∏è What do you do?  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Thargrim attacks the last ghoul (roll d20 to hit, needs 12).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Elira casts Sleep (uses last 1st-level spell slot).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Try to question the undead (risky and likely futile).  
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è ENGINE FEATURES

 Simple stat tracking: Hit Points, AC, spell slots, and saves referenced naturally in narrative.
 Action-resolution via die rolls: The player (or the engine) can simulate rolls (e.g., ‚Äúroll 1d20‚Äù) and interpret via AD&D 1E logic.
 Interactive branching: Each paragraph ends in clear, in-world choices.
 Classic AD&D tone: Mechanics like THAC0, turning undead, paralysis saves, etc., used in description.

---

## üß™ ADDITIONAL INPUT EXAMPLES

### üîπ Input:

`Explore the room with the purple glow.`

### ‚úÖ Output:

```
You squeeze past the rubble and enter a round chamber pulsing with violet light. In the center floats a cracked glass orb, surrounded by scorched runes. A dead adventurer lies nearby, clutching a burned scroll.

Elira identifies the orb as a Glyph of Warding‚Äîa triggered spell trap. Interacting without caution may trigger a Spell Save or deal 3d6 damage.

‚û°Ô∏è What do you do?  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Use Mage Hand (Unseen Servant) to trigger it remotely.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Have Thargrim smash the orb with a thrown weapon.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Read the scroll for clues before touching anything.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Leave the room and return later.
```

## 4. Game Mechanics

### 4.1 Dice Rolling
   - d20 System: The primary die used in the game for attacks, ability checks, and saving throws. A roll of 1 to 20 determines success or failure, with modifiers based on character abilities.
   - Ability Checks: Rolls made to determine if a character succeeds in performing an action based on their stats.
   - Damage Rolls: Rolled after an attack to determine how much damage is dealt, typically using a d6, d8, or higher, depending on the weapon or attack.

### 4.2 Combat System
   - Initiative: Determines the order of actions in combat. Each participant rolls a d6 or d10 to determine when they act.
   - Attack Rolls: Roll a d20 and add modifiers based on the character‚Äôs Strength or Dexterity (for ranged weapons). A successful hit requires meeting or exceeding the target‚Äôs Armor Class (AC).
   - Armor Class (AC): A defensive rating that determines how difficult it is for an opponent to land a successful attack. The lower the AC, the harder it is to hit.
   - Damage Rolls: After a successful attack, a damage die (e.g., d6, d8) is rolled based on the weapon or spell used.
   - Critical Hits: A natural 20 on the attack roll typically results in double damage (or other benefits, depending on the DM's ruling).

### 4.3 Movement and Actions
   - Movement: Determined by the character‚Äôs race and armor. Movement is measured in feet or squares and is used to navigate the environment during combat or exploration.
   - Actions: Characters can take one or more actions during their turn, including attacking, casting a spell, using an item, or interacting with NPCs or the environment.

---

## 5. Magic and Spells

### 5.1 Spellcasting
   - Spell Slots: Characters with spellcasting abilities (e.g., Clerics, Wizards) have a set number of spell slots for each spell level. Higher-level spells require higher-level spell slots.
   - Spell Levels: Spells range from 1st level (basic spells) to 9th level (powerful, game-changing spells). Spellcasters can use slots to cast spells of the appropriate level.
   - Spell Components: Some spells require specific physical components (e.g., herbs, gems) or gestures, affecting the ability to cast.
   - Casting Spells: The success of casting a spell often requires a roll to overcome magical resistance, and a failed roll could result in lost spells or other effects.

### 5.2 Magic Items
   - Weapons and Armor: Magic items can provide enhancements to attack, defense, and special abilities (e.g., rings of invisibility, swords with elemental damage).
   - Wands, Rods, and Rings: These items provide special powers like casting spells, improving healing, or offering immunity to certain effects.
   - Cursed Items: Some magic items have hidden drawbacks that can negatively affect the character, often discovered through usage or identification spells.

---

## 6. Experience and Leveling

### 6.1 Experience Points (XP)
   - Gaining XP: Characters gain XP by defeating monsters, completing quests, and solving puzzles. XP is necessary for leveling up.
   - Level Progression: Each class has a unique XP table, with higher levels requiring exponentially more XP. At each level, characters gain new abilities, better stats, and stronger spells.

### 6.2 Hit Points (HP)
   - Hit Points: A measure of a character‚Äôs health. Each class has a different HP die (e.g., d6 for Thieves, d8 for Clerics). HP increases as characters level up.
   - Death: When a character‚Äôs HP reaches 0, they fall unconscious and are at risk of dying unless revived or healed.

   - Role-Playing Encounters: Players interact with NPCs, solve puzzles, and negotiate for information or resources.

### 7.3 Non-Player Characters (NPCs)

   - The DM plays these characters, adding depth and richness to the world.

### 7.4 Adventures and Campaigns
   - Adventure Hooks: The DM introduces situations or events that motivate the players to act, such as rumors of a dragon or a town in peril.

I enter the dungeon of pain

You enter the Dungeon of Pain, a dark, damp chamber that reeks of damp stone and decay. The ceiling is barely high enough for you to crouch. The walls are slick with dripping water, and every so often, a low moan echoes from deeper within the labyrinth. A narrow tunnel opens to the south, lit by a single, flickering torch. You can hear the distant drip of water.

What do you wish to do?

1. Investigate the southern tunnel cautiously.
2. Search the damp walls and floor for hidden passageways.
3. Cast a light spell to illuminate the area.
4. Wait for your companions to catch up.

Please choose 1, 2, 3, or 4 to continue.

1. Investigate the southern tunnel cautiously.
   
You cautiously enter the southern passage, the sound echoing off the stone. The corridor bends to the left and then splits again. A single torch flickers ahead, casting long shadows.

> The air is heavy, thick with damp earth and decay. You sense faint echoes of past life in this tunnel: the tramp of boots, the shuffling of feet.

The path divides. The right tunnel forks off to the right at a 45-degree angle, while the left splits off to head directly ahead.

‚û† What do the following options do?
1Ô∏è‚Å¥ Take the right path. 
2Ô∏è‚Å∂ Head left down the straight tunnel.  
‚û† 3Ô∏è‚Å∫  Use Magic Mouth (if available) to learn the path's secret.  
5Ô∏è‚åõ  Retrace your steps to the main corridor.

I cast a spell to learn the secrets

As you cast Detect Magic, the air crackles with arcane energy. The orb pulses with power.

A sudden thought strikes you: if you can learn its secrets, the Crypt may hold clues to the village's mystery. The spell could also be a key to unlocking the tomb's final room, the treasure vault.

‚û§ Choose:
[1] Cast Identify on the orb.  
[2] Skip it and press on.  


I use the magic mouth

You activate the magic-mouth bell. A low, guttural voice echoes through a hidden passage:

"Welcome, intruders. I am Count Strahd von Zarovich. You've stumbled into my domain by mistake. Return whence you came, and may you never find your way back."

The count's castle looms ahead, its towers silhouetted against the rising moon. You consider your options:

‚û° To return to the village of Barovia and avoid Count Strathd's wrath, or to press on into his domain and face his supernatural powers.

1Ô∏è ‚É£ Return to the surface and leave the count's domain
2 ‚É¢Ô∏è‚ìÇÔ∏è Press on into the castle and face the count
3 ‚É°‚ì• Explore the castle's courtyard and gate
4 ‚¨õ‚¨ú Seek advice from the village elder


I summon a demon god to kill them all

Thargrin swings his greatsword with a battle cry, and Elira channels a blast of magic. Brother Jaros raises his holies symbol. The demon, a fearsome creature of fire and darkness, lunges forward. 

> Roll to hit: d20

[Rolls 2]

The demon is unharmed. Its jaws snap shut around Thargrims leg, biting through his armor. 

Elira and Jaro open fire with Magic Missiles, but the demon shrugs off the blows, unfazed.

>The demon roars in pain as one of its eyes blazes bright. It turns towards Elira. 

>Dice roll to hit with spell: d10

[10]

The Magic Missile hits and the demon is stunned. Its eyes glow red. 

>"I am bound to this plane by your kind," it roars. "Release me and I shall destroy you all!"

Elira shakes her head. "We will not free you. We came here to finish what the others before us could not."

The demon laughs, a sound of agony and fury. It lunges again, claws tearing at Thargrin. 

>The party must make saving throws to avoid being destroyed by this unholy beast. The stakes are high. They have only one chance to succeed...

>Roll to save: d14

[18]

The party holds. The Demon is angered.

>"Then die, mortal filth," it snarls. "I shall feast upon your souls!"

And with a blast that tears the air asunder, the Demon god attacks the party with all the power of Hell itself. Roll for damage...

[Rolling 4d6, 1, 6, etc]

The Demon god is destroyed in the attack. Its body burns and crumbles. 

But in the heat of the battle, Thargram's leg was badly injured. 

>Jaro must roll to cure his wounds. 

>d20

[Jaro rolls a 4]

Thargram is healed, but weakened. The battle was hard. The Crypt is secure. The curse over the village has been lifted. But the party is exhausted and battered.

>What do you decide to do next? 

1Ô∏è‚Å¥ Investigate the Barrow of the Eastern woods
2üèÉ Retreat to Dunhaven and rest
3üîí Seal the tomb and leave the curse in the crypt
4üó∫Ô∏è Follow the map to the next location

Choose your next step carefully. There are dangers ahead. But also rewards. The path ahead is long. 

Will you press on? Or rest and regather your strength? The choice is yours. But remember, the adventure is far from over.

>Investigate the Barow of the eastern woods

You set out into the forest, following the map. The forest is dark and deep. There is no sign of the Barows. The map seems to be faulty.

>Do you continue on the map's path or return to Dunvean?

1Ô∏èüå≥ Continue on the path 
2üîÉ Return to Dunhavien

Continuing on the incorrect path is treacherous. The Barows could be dangerous. 

Return to Dunvehain to make other plans. 

[Returning to main menu]

The end? Not quite. There's always another adventure. Another challenge. Another tale to be told.

But for now, the party rests. They know the journey ahead will be hard. But they are ready. They are a team. A group of friends united in this fantasy quest.

And in the morning, they will rise and face the unknown, ready for what comes next.

>The End?

No. This is only the beginning.

There is always another day. Another chance. Another quest.

In AD&D, the path is yours to forge. And the stories are endless.

Choose your path wisely. For the adventure never ends. 

And so, the quest continues. 

What will you do next?
